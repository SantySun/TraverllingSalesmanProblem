# TraverllingSalesmanProblem
Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city?

**This project is a brute force solution for this problem:**
Enumerate all posible routes and calculate their total distance respectively, then get the shortest path.
